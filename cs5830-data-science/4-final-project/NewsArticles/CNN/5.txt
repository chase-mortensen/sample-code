Anger over shelter-in-place orders boiled over, with protesters ignoring social distancing guidelines and packing state capitols and streets.

"Jesus is my vaccine," said one message on a tractor as it drove past the crowded statehouse in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Monday.
"Freedom over fear," said one protester's sign in Indiana.
"Shutdown the shutdown," another sign in Maryland read.

Across the country, more protests have popped up in both red and blue states. And they have backing from powerful conservative allies in Washington DC, including FreedomWorks, a major conservative group closely associated with the Tea Party, and Stephen Moore, an economist who President Donald Trump tapped as a member of his economic reopening council.
"Our goal is to make these protests as safe as possible and as effective as possible," Moore told CNN. "The whole idea of civil disobedience in a protest is to persuade people (that) what you're doing is speaking up for a cause, you know, that people will feel is just and right."
Moore said he and other conservatives advising the protesters have recommended that people follow health officials' recommendations -- like staying 6 feet apart from others and wearing masks -- while protesting some of those very guidelines.
Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, said a "tipping point" for the activist community was the spate of reports that the Trump administration could use cell phone data to track the spread of coronavirus.
"All of a sudden this is going from a pandemic to an Orwellian nightmare," Brandon said, noting how many people in his network reacted similarly to the news about data tracking.
Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Utah, western New York state and Washington state have all seen protests in recent days.
Car horns blared in the streets of Annapolis, where members of the group Reopen Maryland said the closures of businesses have been financially devastating.
"We don't think that there's any reason we can't protect the elderly and the vulnerable from this virus and still get our small businesses back up to work," Paul Brockman told CNN affiliate WBAL.

A protester in Maryland says she's worried about her future if businesses don't reopen soon.
In Indianapolis, protester Andy Lyons said he understands the health risks. But he wants the government to back off.
"If I get sick, then I am going to bear the consequences of my getting sick," Lyons told CNN affiliate WTHR. "If anybody else gets sick, they bear the consequences of their free choice without government coercion to do so. That's what this is about."
Gubernatorial candidate Tim Eyman speaks during a rally to protest Washinton state's stay-at-home order at the Capitol building Sunday in Olympia.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he understands "the frustration among the people that want to get things open right away. I'm frustrated also."
"We're doing everything we possibly can to reopen in a safe manner," the Republican governor told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday. "But I don't think it's helpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the President's own policy."
It's too early to reopen, according to White House guidelines
In Maryland and Indiana, some protesters wore hats or waved flags that supported President Trump.

But Hogan pointed out that Trump's own proposal for states to reopen in phases wouldn't allow Maryland to open anyway.
Among the guidelines for "Opening Up America Again," states shouldn't start to reopen until they have a downward trajectory of documented cases in a 14-day period or a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests in a 14-day period.
Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors sAssociation, said states such as his own haven't met those White House guidelines yet.
Three Southern governors, though, are ready to slowly reopen their states. The governors of Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina said Monday they'd start the process of reopening businesses in their respective states this week or at the latest next Monday
